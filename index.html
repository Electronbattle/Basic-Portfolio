            <p> I was born right after a meteorite made of the vibration-absorbing mineral vibranium crashed in my home
                land
                Wakanda.
                I sensed early on that outsiders would exploit Wakanda for this valuable resource, so as the ruler, I,
                King
                T'Chaka, (my Wakandan name)
                concealed this country from the outside world. <br> <br>
                My first wife N'Yami died while in labor with T'Challa, and my second wife Ramonda was taken prisoner by
                Anton Pretorius during a visit to her
                homeland of South Africa, so for most of my son T'Challa was raised by me alone. <br> <br>
                My father was murdered by the adventurer Ulysses Klaw in an attempt to seize the vibranium mound. With
                his
                people still in danger, a young T'Challa used
                Klaw's sound weapon on Klaw and his men, shattering Klaw's right hand and forcing him to flee. This made
                me
                a proud father. Now I know when I died the new King
                T'Challa will be a great Ruler and protect our people!</p>
